# SafeDose

# What it does
SafeDose is an app that helps people monitor their opioid intake by allowing users to log their medication intake. SafeDose charts their dosage intake over a week time interval and notifies users if they have taken a higher dosage than the recommended amount. Users can also log their symptoms if they experience any symptoms of an opioid overdose, and SafeDose will recommend them to see a doctor based on what they report.

# Inspiration
Synthetic opioids are common in pharmaceutical medications such as pain killers, however more than 150 people die from synthetic opioid overdose, including fentanyl which is 50 times stronger than heroine. We wanted to make an app that would tackle the opioid crisis and help users watch for the signs of a potential overdose.

# How we built it
SafeDose was built using Swift and the SwiftUI, SwiftCharts, and Vision frameworks.

# Challenges we ran into
One of our biggest challenges was integrating Firebase as our backend as we had to figure out how to save information without users having to create accounts. We also had trouble connecting the backend to the frontend. We also ran into issues with GitHub such as keep tracking of branches and GitHub not displaying updated code at times.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have been able to put an iOS app together in a short amount of time. We experimented with Apple libraries such as SwiftCharts and Vision, exposing us to the vast possibilities of mobile app development. We also had a lot of fun making memories from singing the Mickey Mouse clubhouse song to playing extraneous amounts of badminton at 1 am :)

# What we learned
We learned how to use Apple frameworks that were relatively new to us such as Swift Charts and Vision. We also learned how to work as a team and, most importantly have fun at a hackathon! One of us had never played badminton before and learned for the very first time at HackDavis! ðŸ¥³

# What's next for SafeDose
In the future, we would like to chart dosage intake across hourly and monthly time intervals with SafeDose. We would also like to utilize the CoreML and CreateML frameworks to measure the risk of overdose over the aforementioned time periods.
